### Introduction {-}

- **Defining Anomalies**:
  An anomaly is a rare point or sequence (of a given length) in time series data, often undesired, that deviates significantly from expected behavior.
  - The lack of a precise anomaly definition makes it challenging to create an objective function.
  - This challenge often results in neural networks (NN) underperforming compared to traditional methods in anomaly detection.

- **Key Metrics**:
  - **Anomaly Score**: A value between 0 and 1 assigned to each point in the time series, quantifying its likelihood of being an anomaly.
  - **Detection**: The process of identifying anomalies based on a threshold value above which data points are classified as anomalies.

### Foundations {-}

#### Types of Time Series {-}

1. **Univariate Time Series**:
   - A single series of data.

2. **Multivariate Time Series**:
   - Data with multiple dimensions, such as from multiple sensors or sources.

3. **Normality Patterns**:
   - **Single Normality**: The time series exhibits stationary behavior with a single normal pattern.
   - **Multiple Normality**: The time series alternates between multiple normal patterns over time.
     - This is particularly important in long time series.
     - **Example**: IoT sensor data (e.g., smartwatch readings): a user may switch between walking, running, and then walking again, with each activity having its own "normal" behavior.

#### Types of Anomalies {-}

1. **Point-Based Anomalies**:
   - **Point Anomaly**: A single data point significantly deviates from expected behavior.
   - **Contextual Anomaly**: A data point that appears normal in one context but anomalous in another, depending on surrounding data or external factors.

2. **Subsequence-Based Anomalies**:
   - An entire sequence of points may appear normal when analyzed individually, but the collective evolution or pattern of the sequence is anomalous.
   - **Detection Method**: Use distance measures or shape-based similarity techniques to identify abnormal sequence behavior.

#### Handling Mixed Anomalies {-}
- In real-world time series, it is common for both **point anomalies** and **sequence anomalies** to coexist.
- To effectively detect and classify both types of anomalies, it is critical to use a method that is capable of addressing both categories simultaneously. This often involves combining point-based anomaly scoring with sequence-based pattern recognition techniques.
