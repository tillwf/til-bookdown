## Setup Mail and Mail Command Line

#### Requirements

```bash
sudo apt install msmtp msmtp-mta
```

#### Setup (example with Fastmail)

Run

```bash
msmtp --configure
```

and add the line

```
password       XXXXXXXXXX
```

to the file `~/.msmtprc`.

Example for a self-hosted domain used with fastmail:

```
account default
host smtp.fastmail.com
port 465
tls on
tls_starttls off
auth on
user <fastmail login mail>
from server@yourdomain.com
password <pass>
```


Change its rights:

```bash
chmod 600 .msmtprc
```

and check the symlink of `sendmail`:

```bash
ls -la /usr/sbin/sendmail
```

it should return:

```
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 12 nov.  28  2016 /usr/sbin/sendmail -> ../bin/msmtp
```

Finally, make a test:

```bash
echo -e "Subject:Test\n\nIt Works" | msmtp --from test@yourdomain.com <destination_mail_address>
```

You need the `-e` to interpret the backslash

You can also send html pages (this is `sample.html`):

```html
From: sender@mail.com
To: recipient@mail.com
Subject: This is the Subject
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/html

<html>
  <head>This is Email Head</head>
  <body>
    <h2>This is the Main Title</h2>
    <p>This is the body text</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

then do

```bash
$ cat sample.html | msmtp recipient@mail.com
```
