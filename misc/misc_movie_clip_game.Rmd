## Movie Clips Blind Test

The goal of this game is to show short clips (~10 secondes) of movies and try
to guess the movie list.

### Solution 1

Cut every movies into short clips. Put these files into a folder and play files
of this folder randomly using any video player.

#### Script to split every movie into equal clips  {-}

```bash
j=0
for i in *.mp4
do
    ffmpeg -i "$i" \
           -ss 600 \
           -t 3600 \
           -c copy \
           -map 0 \
           -segment_time 00:00:10 \
           -f segment \
           -reset_timestamps 1 res/${j}_%06d.mp4
    ((j=j+1))
done
```

Explanation:

```
j=0
```

This line initializes a variable `j` to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the segment number.

```
for i in *.mp4
do
```

This line starts a `for` loop that iterates over all the MP4 files in the current directory.

```
    ffmpeg -i "$i" \
           -ss 600 \
           -t 3600 \
           -c copy \
           -map 0 \
           -segment_time 00:00:10 \
           -f segment \
           -reset_timestamps 1 res/${j}_%06d.mp4
```

This line uses FFmpeg to split each input MP4 file into 10-second segments. Here's what each option does:

- `-i "$i"` specifies the input file.
- `-ss 600` specifies the start time in seconds. In this case, it starts at 10 minutes (600 seconds) into the video.
- `-t 3600` specifies the duration in seconds. In this case, it extracts 1 hour (3600 seconds) of video.
- `-c copy` specifies that the video and audio codecs should be copied without re-encoding.
- `-map 0` specifies that all streams from the input file should be included in the output.
- `-segment_time 00:00:10` specifies the duration of each segment.
- `-f segment` specifies the output format as segmented MP4 files.
- `-reset_timestamps 1` specifies that the timestamps of the output segments should be reset to zero.
- `res/${j}_%06d.mp4` specifies the output file name pattern. `%06d` is a placeholder for the segment number, padded with leading zeros to 6 digits. `${j}` is the current value of the variable `j`. The segments are saved in the `res/` directory.

```
    ((j=j+1))
```
This line increments the `j` variable by 1.


In summary, this script splits each MP4 video file in the current directory into 10-second segments starting from the 10th minute of the video and extracts 1 hour of video. The output segments are saved in the `res/` directory with a filename pattern that includes the segment number.

#### Plays the video randomly  {-}

`Vlc` could be a good solution but between each video the screen flickers and
we see the desktop. Instead we will use `mpv`:

```
find . -iregex ".*\.\(mp4\|flv\|MOV\|webm\|avi\|mpg\|mpeg\)" -type f -exec  mpv --fs --shuffle --loop-playlist=inf "{}" +
```

### Solution 2 (to be enhanced)

We want to avoid recreating data so we will randomly play part of each movie
programmatically using a python (`3.10.6`) script:

```python
import os
import random
from moviepy.video.io.VideoFileClip import VideoFileClip
# Needs to be imported to be able to call the method `preview`
from moviepy.editor import *

# Set the path to the folder containing the movies
path = "."

# Get a list of all the mp4 files in the folder
files = [os.path.join(path, f) for f in os.listdir(path) if f.endswith(".mp4")]

# Preload movie and its duration:
data = {}
for file in files:
    print(f"Loading {file}")
    clip = VideoFileClip(file)
    duration = clip.duration
    data[file] = (clip, duration)

# Loop through each movie file and play a random 10-second clip
while True:
    # Choose a file randomly
    file = random.choice(files)

    # Load the video file clip
    clip, duration = data[file]

    # Set the start time of the clip to a random value between 0 and (duration - 10)
    start_time = random.uniform(0, duration - 10)

    # Set the end time of the clip to 10 seconds after the start time
    end_time = start_time + 10

    # Extract the 10-second clip
    subclip = clip.subclip(start_time, end_time)

    # Display the clip
    subclip.preview(fullscreen=True)
```

The requirements are:

```python
moviepy==1.0.3
pygame==2.4.0
```
